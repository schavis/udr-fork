**Merge branch**

Make sure you create your PR against the correct **base** branch. For instructions, refer to
GitHub's **Change the branch range and destination repository guide** (https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

If your content is an update to:

- Currently published content

  Choose **base: main** when you are updating published documentation, and you
  want your changes published when the PR is merged. We publish Nomad content
  from the `main` branch.

- Upcoming Nomad release

  Choose the branch for the Nomad release that your content is for. Nomad
  release branches use the `nomad/<exact-release-number>` format. If you are not
  able to find the upcoming Nomad release branch that you are looking for,
  contact the tech writer that works with the Nomad team.

- Upcoming Nomad release but not sure which one

  - Choose the `main` branch.
  - Add the "do not merge" label.
  - Convert the PR to a DRAFT.
  - Put an explanation in the **Description** section.

  The tech writer coordinates with Nomad engineering and updates
  the docs PR base branch when the code is slotted into an upcoming release.

**Backports**

This repo stores previous version docs in folders instead of branches. There are
no backport labels.  If you backported your code PR to previous branches, update
the docs content in the corresponding folders. For example, if the current
release is 1.10.x and you backported your code to 1.9.x and 1.8.x, update the docs content
in the v1.10.x, v1.9.x, and v1.8.x folders. If you can't find the relevant files in previous versions,
add a note to your PR description. The tech writer will help ensure that the previous versions
receive the correct updates.
