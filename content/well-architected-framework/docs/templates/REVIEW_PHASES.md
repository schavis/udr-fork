# Documentation Review Phase Template

Use this template for comprehensive documentation reviews. Complete phases in order for best results.

> **Key principle:** WAF docs explain the **why and what**, show a representative example, then direct users to tutorials and product docs for the **how**. They are directories, not tutorials.

---

## How to Request Reviews

**File relationships:**
- **REVIEW_PHASES.md** (this file) = **Review process** - Step-by-step workflow, review questions, deliverables
- **AGENTS.md** = **Writing standards** - Formatting rules, content patterns, SEO/AI criteria, examples
- **doc-templates/DOCUMENT_TEMPLATE.md** = Practical template for creating new documents

**Clear separation:**
- This file tells you **how to review** (process, phases, questions)
- AGENTS.md tells you **what good documentation looks like** (standards, patterns, rules)
- Review phases reference specific AGENTS.md sections for detailed standards

**Quick commands:**

| What you want | How to ask | Skills to use |
|---------------|------------|---------------|
| Full review with fixes | "Full review on [document]. Implement fixes." | `/review-doc <file> --phases 1-7` |
| Quick style check | "Quick style check" | `/quick-styleguide <file> --fix` |
| Full style check | "Full style check" | `/check-hashicorp-style <file> --fix` |
| Structure check | "Check structure" | `/check-structure <file> --fix` |
| Code validation | "Validate code examples" | `/code-review <file>` |
| Full review, no edits | "Full review on [document]. Review only, don't edit." | `/review-doc <file> --report-only` |
| Style check only | "Phase 4 review on [document]." | `/check-structure`, `/check-hashicorp-style` |
| Specific phase | "Phase [1-7] review on [document]." | See table below |
| Final polish | "Phases 4-7 review on [document]. Fix issues." | Run phases 4-7 skills |

**Comprehensive review:**
```bash
/review-doc <file> --phases 1-7    # Runs all phases automatically
```

---

## Phase 1: User Success Evaluation (PRIORITY)
**Goal:** Ensure users understand the problem/solution and can find resources to implement

**Quick automation:**
```bash
/gap-analysis <file>        # Identify content and concept gaps
/persona-coverage <file>    # Analyze decision-maker vs implementer balance
```

Review questions:
- Does the doc clearly explain what problem it solves and when to use this approach?
- Can an implementer understand what to build and find the resources to do it?
- Is there a representative code example that illustrates the concept?
- Does the doc connect to related WAF docs and external resources for the full workflow?
- Are the resource links specific enough for implementers to take action?

**Deliverable:** User success review document identifying gaps for:
- Decision-maker persona (understands WHY and WHAT)
- Implementer persona (knows what to build and where to learn HOW)

---

## Phase 2: Technical Accuracy & Fact-Checking
**Goal:** Verify all technical content is correct and current

**Quick automation:**
```bash
/content-freshness <file>    # Track content currency, detect outdated info
/code-review <file>          # Validate code examples with formatters/linters
```

Review questions:
- Are code examples syntactically correct and tested?
- Are version numbers accurate for tools/providers?
- Are deprecated patterns or APIs used?
- Do examples follow current best practices?
- Are security recommendations still valid?
- Do configuration examples actually work?

**Deliverable:** List of technical corrections needed with line numbers

---

## Phase 3: Cross-Document Relationships
**Goal:** Ensure docs form a cohesive workflow

**Quick automation:**
```bash
/smart-cross-reference <file>    # Auto-detect workflows, suggest links
/add-resources <file>            # Enhance resources sections
```

Review questions:
- Do related documents reference each other appropriately?
- Are HashiCorp Resources sections complete with internal cross-links?
- Is the workflow progression clear (classify → protect → encrypt → tokenize)?
- Are there orphaned docs that should connect to the set?
- Do overview docs point to implementation docs?

**Deliverable:** Cross-reference additions for HashiCorp Resources sections

---

## Phase 4: Document structure compliance
**Goal:** Validate WAF-specific document structure and formatting from AGENTS.md

**Quick automation:**
```bash
/check-structure <file> --fix          # Structure patterns
/check-hashicorp-style <file> --fix    # HashiCorp style guide (comprehensive)
/quick-styleguide <file> --fix         # HashiCorp style guide (faster)
/check-code-examples <file>            # Code example completeness
/check-resources <file> --fix          # Resources section formatting
/check-consistency <file>              # Terminology consistency
```

Review checklist:
- [ ] "Why" sections use **Bold challenge:** format with 3-4 challenges
- [ ] Workflow connections in body text ("After classifying...")
- [ ] No vague pronouns at sentence start
- [ ] Lists use "the following" introduction (except resource sections)
- [ ] Heading capitalization follows sentence case
- [ ] Document structure matches pattern (intro, Why, implementation sections, resources)
- [ ] Document ending order: HashiCorp resources → External resources → Next steps

**Deliverable:** Style compliance fixes ready to commit

---

## Phase 5: SEO & AI/LLM Optimization
**Goal:** Maximize discoverability for both search engines and AI systems

**Quick automation:**
```bash
/seo-optimize <file>    # Automated SEO and AI/LLM optimization
```

**Review against:** Use `/seo-optimize` skill for complete SEO and AI/LLM optimization criteria.

The skill checks:
- Meta descriptions (150-160 characters)
- Title and heading optimization
- First paragraph keyword placement
- Link descriptions
- AI/LLM retrieval patterns (topic sentences, relationships, question-answer patterns)
- Internal linking and keyword density

**Deliverable:** SEO and AI/LLM improvements including optimized meta descriptions, enhanced link descriptions, improved section structure for AI retrieval, and explicit relationship statements

---

## Phase 6: Link Quality & Balance
**Goal:** Provide right mix of beginner and advanced resources

Review questions:
- Are link descriptions optimized with action verbs and outcomes?
- Is there balance between "getting started" and "advanced" links?
- Are beginners given clear next steps?
- Are advanced users given depth without overwhelming basics?
- Are external resources credible and current?
- Are HashiCorp resources grouped logically with descriptive headings?

**Deliverable:** Enhanced link descriptions and balanced resource sections

---

## Phase 7: Final User Success Check
**Goal:** Validate that both personas would succeed with this document

**Quick automation:**
```bash
/persona-coverage <file>    # Final persona balance check
/gap-analysis <file>        # Final gap analysis
```

This final phase steps back from the checklist details to ask: **Do the docs make sense? Would a user be successful following them?**

WAF documents serve two personas. Validate the document works for both:

**Decision-maker questions** (CTOs, architects, staff engineers):
- Can they understand the strategic value in under 2 minutes?
- Can they articulate why this matters to their organization?
- Can they make an informed decision about which approach or tool to use?
- Can they confidently send this document to their implementers?

**Implementer questions** (DevOps, platform, and other engineers):
- Can they understand what to build or implement?
- Do they have concrete examples to adapt?
- Can they find the resources to complete implementation?
- Would they know what to do next after reading this?
- Are there practical workflow details missing that would cause them to get stuck?

**Final validation:**
- Does the document address common alternatives and when to use each?
- Does the example actually work, or is it too abstract to adapt?
- Would users know where to go if something goes wrong?

If the answer to any question is "no", revisit the content before finalizing.

**Deliverable:** Final confirmation that the document serves both decision-makers and implementers, or list of gaps to address

---

## Phase 8: Code example validation
**Goal:** Ensure all code examples are syntactically correct and validated by tooling.

**Quick automation:**
```bash
/code-review <file>    # Comprehensive code validation with formatters/validators
```

Only run Phase 8 when you explicitly request it. Requests like "do a full review" (Phases 1–7) do not include Phase 8.

This phase is required for documents that include Terraform, Packer, CLI, or other copy/paste-able examples.

Review checklist:
- [ ] Verify every code block is complete (no missing braces, closing fences, or required context)
- [ ] Run formatters/linters where possible (for example: `terraform fmt -check`, `packer fmt -check`)
- [ ] Run validators where possible (for example: `terraform validate`, `packer validate`)
- [ ] Replace examples that cannot validate in isolation (for example, file provisioners that require local paths) with self-contained examples
- [ ] Confirm placeholder values are clearly marked (for example, `your-organization`) and do not look production-ready
- [ ] Record the command output and tool versions used for validation

**Deliverable:** Confirmation that examples validate successfully, including the tool versions used, or a list of fixes required.

---

## Usage Patterns

**Comprehensive review:** Run all 7 phases in order. Create review documents in Phases 1-3 before editing.

**New documentation:** Run Phases 1-3 first. Add Phases 4-7 for polish after content is solid.

**Style-only review:** Run Phase 4 only.

**Note:** Do NOT combine Phase 1 with other phases. It requires separate cognitive focus on user success.
