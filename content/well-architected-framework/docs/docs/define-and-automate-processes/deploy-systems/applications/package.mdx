# Package application

Packaging your application is the process of turning your source code, configuration, and dependencies into a single deployable artifact, such as a virtual machine image or Docker container.

[Packer](/packer) lets you create identical artifacts for multiple platforms, such as AWS, Azure, and GCP, from a single source template. Packer templates define which source images to use and the steps to build your artifacts.

HCP Packer stores and manages metadata associated with the artifacts you build with Packer, such as inheritance between artifacts HCP Packer lets you label artifact versions with channels. If you find a security issue in an artifact and want to prevent people from deploying it, you can revoke a version of an artifact and point the label to a fixed, or previous version.

You can use the [Terraform HCP provider](/packer/tutorials/hcp-get-started) to query your HCP Packer registry from your Terraform configuration and ensure that your infrastructure is using the most up-to-date artifact version.

Together, this creates a golden image pipeline. This pipeline may look like the following example:

1. Your DevOps team builds a base OS image that includes common dependencies between your applications.
1. Your application team builds their application image on top of the base image.
1. Your platform team deploys the application image with Terraform.
1. If your security team finds a vulnerability, they can update the base image and revoke the vulnerable version so that no new images are built on top of it.
1. Since HCP Packer knows the child images are now out of date, it shows which images need to be rebuilt on the new base image.

## Next steps

In this document, you learned that you should package your application into a deployable artifact, such as a virtual machine image or Docker container. You can use Packer to create these artifacts and HCP Packer to manage them. Visit the following documents to learn more about packaging your application with Packer.

In this section of [Develop and test](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/develop-and-test), you learned how to package your application into a deployable artifact, such as a virtual machine image or Docker container. Develop and test is part of the [Define and automate processes pillar](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes).
