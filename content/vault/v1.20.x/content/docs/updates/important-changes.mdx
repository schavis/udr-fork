# Important changes

**Last updated**: 2025-08-13

Always review important or breaking changes and remediation recommendations
before upgrading Vault.

---

## Breaking changes

### Explicit disable_mlock setting required for integrated storage ((#disable_mlock-config))

| Change       | Affected version | Vault edition
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------
| Breaking     | 1.20.0           | All

Prior to Vault 1.20, the default setting for `disable_mlock` was `false`, but as
of Vault 1.20.0, `disable_mlock` is a required configuration setting for
clusters using integrated storage. The change to `disable_mlock` affects all
cluster types: primary, performance secondary, and DR secondary.

You do not need to update clusters that already set an explicit value for
`disable_mlock`. Servers running in `dev` mode` also start and run as usual
because the default configuration sets `disable_mlock` explicitly and `dev` mode
requires explicit values for `disable_mlock` when you provide a custom
configuration for the server.

### Recommendation

If your server configuration currently uses the default value for `disable_mlock`
(`false`), and you want to maintain that behavior, you must you explicitly set
`disable_mlock = false` in the outermost level of the server configuration for
all server nodes.

Additionally:

- **If you use autopilot for upgrades**, Vault adds nodes running 1.20.x to the
  cluster until it reaches a quorum of upgraded nodes. You must set an explicit
  value for `disable_mlock` on each of the nodes before upgrading.

- **If you use rolling upgrades**, Vault stops and upgrades standby nodes one at
  a time. You must update the configuration for each node before restarting the
  `vault` process on that node.

Refer to the [`mlock-config`](/vault/docs/configuration#disable_mlock) server
configuration documentation for more informaiton.

### Rekey cancellations use a nonce ((#rekey-cancel-nonce))

| Change       | Affected version                          | Vault edition
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------
| Breaking     | 1.20.0, 1.19.6, 1.18.11, 1.17.18, 1.16.21 | All

Vault 1.20.0, 1.19.6, 1.18.11, 1.17.18, and 1.16.21 require a nonce to cancel
[rekey](/vault/api-docs/system/rekey) and
[rekey recovery key](/vault/api-docs/system/rekey-recovery-key) operations
within 10 minutes of initializing a rekey request. Cancellation requests after
the 10 minute window do not require a nonce and succeed as expected.

#### Recommendation

To cancel a rekey operation, provide the nonce value from the
`/sys/rekey/init` or `sys/rekey-recovery-key/init` response.


### Auzre authentication requires bound group or service principal ID ((#azure-auth))

| Change       | Affected version | Vault edition
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------
| Breaking     | 1.20.0           | All

Azure authentication roles must specify either `bound_group_ids` or
`bound_service_principal_ids` in the role definition to prevent excessively
permissive access.

Requiring a bound group or service principal ID ensures that policies for the
role reflect the the specific needs of the application or service. For example:

```shell-session
$ vault write auth/azure/role/dev-role \
    policies="prod,dev" \
    bound_subscription_ids=6a1d5988-5917-4221-b224-904cd7e24a25 \
    bound_resource_groups=vault \
    bound_service_principal_ids=3cb88732-1356-4782-b671-4877166be01a
```

Refer to the
[Azure authentication plugin documentation](/vault/docs/auth/azure) for more
information.


### CVE-2025-6000: File audit devices cannot use executable file permissions ((#cve-2025-6000))

| Change       | Affected version                     | Vault edition
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | -------------
| Breaking     | 1.20.1+, 1.19.7+, 1.18.12+, 1.16.23+ | All

File audit devices require explicit configuration for prefixing and cannot use
executable file permissions.  You must set `allow_audit_log_prefixing` to `true`
in your server configuration to enable `file` audit devices with the `prefix`
option. Additionally, `file` audit devices cannot use file modes with executable
permissions (e.g., 0777, 0755).

#### Recommendation

If you use `file` audit devices:

1. Add `allow_audit_log_prefixing = true` to your Vault server configuration if
   you want to use the `prefix` option.
1. Use non-executable file modes (e.g., 0644, 0666) for log files.

## New behavior

### Key pair authentication for Snowflake DB secrets engine ((#snowflake-keypair-auth))

| Change       | Affected version | Vault edition
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------
| New behavior | 1.20.0           | All

As of version 1.20.0, Vault supports
[Snowflake database authentication using key pairs](/vault/api-docs/secret/databases#configure-connection)
as an alternative to password authentication, which Snowflake plans to disable
in November 2025. Vault support for password authentication with Snowflake is
now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

#### Recommendation

Vault currently does not support rotate root for key pairs. To manually rotate
key pairs:

1. Update the root configuration in Vault with the new private key
1. Update the public key associated with the user in Snowflake

For more information on rotating key pairs, please refer
to the official [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth#configuring-key-pair-rotation).


### Audience warning for Kubernetes authentication roles ((#k8-audience-warning))

| Change       | Affected version | Vault edition
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| New behavior | 1.20.0           | All

Vault logs a warning when you create or update a Kubernetes auth role without an
audience.

#### Recommendation

We recommend updating your policies before Vault makes the audience value
required for all Kubernetes authentication roles so Vault can explicitly
validate that the audience claim in JWT tokens (`aud`) is intended for Vault and
not another service. For example:

```shell-session
$ vault write auth/kubernetes/role/demo      \
    bound_service_account_names=myapp        \
    bound_service_account_namespaces=default \
    policies=default                         \
    ttl=1h
```

## Known issues

### Duplicate unseal/seal wrap HSM keys ((#hsm-keys)) <EnterpriseAlert inline="true" />

| Change      | Status | Affected version                       | Fixed version
| ----------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- | --------------------
| Known issue | Open   | 1.20.x, 1.19.x, 1.18.x, 1.17.x, 1.16.x | None

In HSM-HA configurations migrating from Shamir to HSM-backed unseal/seal wraps,
Vault may create duplicate HSM keys when you migrate from Shamir to an
HSM-backed unseal configuration for high availability (HA) HSM deployments. Key
duplication can happen even after a seal migration to HSM that initially
appears successful.

Duplicate HSM keys can cause the following errors:

- intermittent read failures with errors like `CKR_SIGNATURE_INVALID` and
  `CKR_KEY_HANDLE_INVALID` for [seal-wrapped values](/vault/docs/enterprise/sealwrap#wrapped-parameters).
- nodes fail to unseal after a restart with errors such as `CKR_DATA_INVALID`.

#### Recommendation

Always run Vault with `generate_key = false` and manually create all required
keys within the HSM during the setup process.


### Secondary cluster reload overwrites development cluster setting ((#development-cluster-reload)) <EnterpriseAlert inline="true" />

| Change       | Affected version | Fixed version
| ------------ |------------------| --------------------
| Known issue  | 1.20.0           | 1.20.1

If the Vault process receives a `SIGHUP` and reloads a secondary performance
replication cluster, the cluster reverts to the locally configured
`development_cluster` value instead of following the value configured on the
primary cluster.

#### Recommendation

Ensure all clusters in a performance replication group have the same
`development_cluster` value configured in HCL to prevent unexpected changes to the reported value.


### GUI login fails for auth mounts with underscores and unauthenticated listing ((#ui-login-underscore))

| Change       | Affected version | Fixed version
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| Known issue  | 1.20.0           | 1.20.1

Login requests to auth methods mounted at paths using underscores (e.g. `oidc_test`)
with `listing_visibility="unauth"` fail because the GUI calls the wrong
endpoint. Mounts with dashes (e.g. `oidc-test`) work correctly.

#### Recommendation

As a workaround, you can log in to the GUI using the following steps:

1. Navigate directly to the URL for the desired method type (e.g. `${VAULT_ADDR}/ui/vault/auth?with=oidc`)
1. Click "Sign in with other methods &rarr;"
1. Select the method type from the dropdown
1. Click **Advanced settings** and provide the correct path (e.g., `oidc_test`).

We also recommend creating a [custom GUI message](/vault/docs/ui/custom-messages)
describing the workaround steps for users.


### GUI navigation error for KV v2 secret paths containing underscores ((#ui-kvv2-underscore-secrets))

| Change       | Affected version | Fixed version
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| Known issue  | 1.20.0           | 1.20.1

Users without policy permissions granting `read` access to the
[`/subkeys` endpoint](/vault/api-docs/secret/kv/kv-v2#read-secret-subkeys)
receive an error when navigating to KV v2 secrets with an underscore in the name
(e.g. `my_secret`).

#### Recommendation

As a workaround, you can use the [GUI CLI emulator](/vault/docs/ui/web-cli) to
read secret data or metadata.

You can also use the API explorer to make any HTTP request:

1. Select **Tools** from the Vault GUI sidebar.
1. Click **API Explorer**.
1. Enter the KV v2 plugin mount path in the "Filter by tag" search bar.
1. Expand the endpoint for the action you wish to perform and click **Try it out**.
1. Provide the required parameters. For example, to read a KV v2 secret the `path` must be provided.
1. Provide any optional parameters desired.
1. Click **Execute** to perform the HTTP request.


### Failing credential refresh for Snowflake DB secrets engine key pair authentication ((#snowflake-keypair-refresh))

| Change      | Affected version                       | Fixed version
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------
| Known issue | 1.20.x, 1.19.x, 1.18.x+ent, 1.17.x+ent, 1.16.x+ent | None

Users using keypair authentication with Snowflake databases may receive errors
due to improper credential refreshes and stale connections in the connection pool.
When two or more concurrent operations occur, Vault tries to reuse an idle
connection from the pool and the request fails due to session timeout in the
Snowflake database.

#### Recommendation

As a workaround, you can set the `max_connection_lifetime` to a value below `SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINS`.


### Duplicate LDAP password rotations on standby node check-in ((#ldap-checkin))

| Change       | Affected version | Fixed version
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------
| Known issue  | 1.12.x           | None

Performing Vault check-ins for LDAP service accounts on a performance standby
node or nodes in a performance standby cluster can trigger duplicate password
changes on the LDAP server.

Duplication occurs when the LDAP client on the local node successfully modifies
a password before Vault forwards the check-in request to the active node, which
then performs a second password update.

While users still receive the latest password, the secondary update may lead to
unexpected LDAP activity and cause confusion interpreting audit logs.

### Recommendation

Send check-in requests directly to the active node of the primary cluster to
prevent duplicate password rotations on the LDAP server.
