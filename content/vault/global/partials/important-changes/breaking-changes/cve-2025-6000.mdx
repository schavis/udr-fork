### CVE-2025-6000: File audit devices cannot use executable file permissions ((#cve-2025-6000))

| Change       | Affected version                     | Vault edition
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | -------------
| Breaking     | 1.20.1+, 1.19.7+, 1.18.12+, 1.16.23+ | All

File audit devices require explicit configuration for prefixing and cannot use
executable file permissions.

Vault will not unseal on upgrade if your only configured audit device is a
`file` device with the executable
[mode](/vault/docs/commands/audit/enable#command-arguments) set.

Vault `file` audit devices cannot use file modes with executable permissions
(e.g., 0777, 0755), and should be configured with `0644` permissions
(or similar).

Additionally, to enable `file` audit devices with the `prefix` option, you must
set `allow_audit_log_prefixing` to `true` in your server configuration on each
node in your cluster.

#### Recommendation

If you use `file` audit devices:

1. Add `allow_audit_log_prefixing = true` to your Vault server configuration if
   you want to use the `prefix` option.
1. Use non-executable file modes (e.g., 0644, 0666) for log files.
